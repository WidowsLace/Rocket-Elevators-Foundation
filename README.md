The the tables use mysql and postgres databases and access must be added in the *database.yml* file. 

The following was added to the config/database.yml file with the inclusion of the SecondBase gem:

```bash
secondbase:
  development:
    adapter: postgresql
    database: postgres_dev
  test:
    adapter: postgresql
    database: postgres_test
```
Go ahead and create the table and model by using this line of code in the command line then proceed to the next step
```bash
rails g model Interventions
```
```bash
rails g migration AddColumnsToIntervention
```
After the creation, migration, and seeding of the database tables using the appropriate command:
```bash
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```
within a command line, the following line of code must be executed to extract the seeded data and inject it into the postgres data warehouse: 

```bash
rails runner lib/tasks/converter.rb
```

To make a ticket with freshdesk, you have to make sure that you have an account with an API key.

You can find the api key by going to top right> profile settings> Your API key

After copying your API key, head over to [Developers.Freshdesk](https://developer.freshdesk.com/api/v1/#introduction), and login.

Follow the documentation on how to impliment it into your code, and *make sure to have your API key private, as github WILL take it down.*

Go into your leads controller inside your admin/models folder, and configure your code to match what is needed to be submitted as a support ticket/feature request.

The gem needed for this API is
	```gem "freshdesk"```

Put the gem inside your gemfile, then run
	
``` bash
bundle install
```
```bash
#in your interventions controller
api_key = ENV['FRESHDESK_API']
        # Your freshdesk domain
        # freshdesk_domain = 'rocketelevators.freshdesk.com/helpdesk/tickets'
        freshdesk_domain = 'rocketelevators'
        # It could be either your user name or api_key.
        # api_key: ENV['FRESHDESK_API']
        # If you have given api_key, then it should be x. If you have given user name, it should be password
        if @intervention.report == nil
        @intervention.report = "n/a"
        end
        if @intervention.result == nil
        @intervention.result = "n/a"
        end
        if @intervention.status == nil
        @intervention.status = "n/a"
        end
	.
	.
	.
	etc...
        json_payload = {
            status: 2,
            priority: 1,
            "description": "the result of the intervention was " + @intervention.result blah blah blah blah here,
        }.to_json
        freshdesk_api_path = 'api/v2/tickets'
        freshdesk_api_url  = "https://#{freshdesk_domain}.freshdesk.com/#{freshdesk_api_path}"
        site = RestClient::Resource.new(freshdesk_api_url, api_key)
```
and thats all to it!
